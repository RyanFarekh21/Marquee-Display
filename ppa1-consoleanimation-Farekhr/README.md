This is a simple C program that creates a marquee display on the terminal using the MacUILib library. The marquee display rotates a string leftward or rightward, and you can interact with the program by providing input to change the direction or add characters to the marquee display. Below are the important sections of the program and how they work:

Preprocessor Directive Constants
Define program-wide constants here using #define. These constants can be used to set various parameters for your program.

Global Variables
exitFlag: A flag used to determine whether to leave the program loop and shut down the program.
cmd: Stores the input command character.
displayString: An array to store the marquee display string.
print_start: The index where the printing should start.
input_pos: The index where an input character will be placed.
direction: Switching printing position (0 for right to left, 1 for left to right).
Function Prototypes
Declare function prototypes to organize the function implementations after the main function for code readability. These prototypes include functions to initialize the program, collect user input, execute the main logic, draw the screen, introduce delays, and clean up resources.

Initialize Function
The Initialize function is called once before the start of the program loop. It initializes global variables and sets up the MacUILib library. You can add more variable initializations here if needed.

GetInput Function
The GetInput function collects user input. It uses asynchronous input collection, meaning the program continues running even if there's no input. When input is detected, the command character is stored in the cmd variable. You can add more input processing logic here if required.

RunLogic Function
The RunLogic function is where the main program logic is executed. It handles the marquee display, rotates the string leftward or rightward, and processes user input. The logic involves updating variables like print_start, input_pos, and direction. You can implement additional features or logic here.

DrawScreen Function
The DrawScreen function is responsible for displaying the program's output. It clears the screen and prints the marquee display on the terminal. It uses the parameters calculated in the RunLogic function to create the animation. You can adjust the frame rate to control the speed of the marquee display.

LoopDelay Function
The LoopDelay function introduces a delay in the program loop to control the animation speed. It uses the MacUILib_Delay function. You can adjust the delay duration to change the animation speed.

CleanUp Function
The CleanUp function is called once at the end of the program to clean up resources. In this case, it calls MacUILib_uninit() to shut down the MacUILib module. In future activities, you may need to add memory deallocation routines to prevent memory leaks.
